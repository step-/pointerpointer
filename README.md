# POINTERPOINTER

PointerPointer is a self-contained shell script that configures and launches one or more pointers to the mouse pointer.
What's the point? You could use a pointer pointer to find your mouse pointer on the screen. You could also use a trail of pointer pointers to highlight the pointer as it moves - this can be useful with some remote meeting and presentation applications that don't display the mouse pointer correctly.  But ultimately, pointer pointer is mostly a fun gadget.
